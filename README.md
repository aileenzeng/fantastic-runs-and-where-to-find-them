# Setup
## Optional (because I haven't gotten it working)
* Download postgres
    * If you have brew, you can type
```
$ brew update
$ brew install postgres
```
* Run the following commands
```
psql fantastic_runs -f init.sql
```

## Local server
* Download `node`
    * Run `npm install` in the home directory
    
* Run `npm start` to start app, (loads at `0.0.0.0:3000`).
